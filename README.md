This project implements a production-style batch ETL pipeline that ingests raw sales data from CSV files, performs data cleaning and validation, and loads the processed data into a PostgreSQL database for analytics and reporting.

The pipeline is built using Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, and Docker, following real-world data engineering best practices such as raw vs processed layers, validation, and logging.
